## Core features

1. **Anomaly Detection**: Provides methods for detecting anomalies in both time-series and tabular data, utilizing Bayesian network conditional distributions and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). It captures density outliers and dependency violations.
2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generates synthetic training data to address class imbalance problems, employing hybrid Bayesian networks with Gaussian mixture models to create balanced datasets that improve model training.
3. **Causal Feature Selection**: Offers feature selection techniques based on causal effects quantified through information theory and post-nonlinear models, identifying features with a non-zero causal impact on KPIs.
4. **Scikit-learn Compatibility**: All estimators and data transformers are designed to be compatible with the scikit-learn framework, facilitating seamless integration into existing machine learning pipelines.
5. **Bayesian Network Modeling**: Core functionality revolves around utilizing Bayesian Networks (BNs) â€“ including Discrete, Continuous and Hybrid types - for data analysis, modeling dependencies, and generating insights.
